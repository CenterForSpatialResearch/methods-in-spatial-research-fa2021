## Selective Digitization

### Due: 10/1

### What

Research and obtain a scanned map, georeference it, and then digitize selected features in order to produce a new map that has a different focus or narrative.  

### Requirements

- Your final work must be a designed map composition in a single image with a 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080 pixels).
- Select one of the map examples discussed thus far during class (look back at lecture slides and/or examples from Miro) and imitate some aspect of its graphic style when designing the map of digitized features. This is the best way to learn and practice designing beautiful maps.

- Your designed map composition must include:
  - title
  - legend
  - scale bar (or two depending on whether you show your map at the same scale...)
  - north arrow (your map doesn't need to have north pointing vertically...)
  - citations for all data sources (please use Chicago style or an equivalent)  
  - projection used
  - your name  

### Submission

- Upload your designed map & a copy of the scanned map you georeferenced:
  - as a single pdf to Canvas
  - add your map & the original scanned map to the pin-up section for 10/1 in the course Miro board
