## Critical Cartography Through Intentional Re/Misuse

### Due: 1/29


*"Data are always collected for a specific purpose, by a combination of people, technology, money, commerce, and government."* (Kurgan 2013, 35)

### The main task

Find two digital spatial datasets about a place (that is **not** New York City) that are related to a topic that interests you and have some relevance to one another. Create a single map which uses these two datasets together to make an argument that was likely not intended by the original creator(s) of either dataset.


### Requirements

- The place you select must be somewhere that you have lived and/or spent a significant enough amount of time to know something about lived experience there.

- I suggest working with vector datasets for this assignment (but not required). When looking for vector geospatial data you should be looking for one of these file types:
  - shapefile
  - geojson
  - KML/KMZ
  - a csv with latitude and longitude coordinates (review tutorial 2 for how to open something like this)
- if you plan to use raster data you should be looking for something with a '.tif' format or that is called a 'geoTIFF' or 'geoJPG'

- Investigate the origins of your two datasets. Some starting points to cover (at a minimum): who made the data? what is/was the intended use(s) the data? when was the data made? how was it made? 

- Research the appropriate projected coordinate reference system to use for your chosen place

- Consider the role that the title and other map elements can play in assisting you in making your argument clear

### Format

- Your final map must be a designed map composition on a single slide with a 16:9 aspect ratio. You are encouraged to select one of the map examples discussed on 1/15 and imitate its graphic style. 
- Your designed map composition must include:
  - title
  - legend
  - scale bar
  - north arrow (your map doesn't need to have north be pointing vertically...)
  - citations for all data sources 
  - projection used
  - your name

### Submission

- Upload your map:
  - as a pdf to Canvas
  - add it to the pin-up Google Slides presentation for 1/29 in the course Google Drive folder

### Starting points/guidance

For sources for spatial datasets see:
- [Columbia Library Geodata Portal](https://geodata.library.columbia.edu)
- Local and State Government operated Open Data Portals
- University Mapping and/or Research Centers. For example:
  - [Eviction Lab. "Eviction Filing Rate & Evictions Rate." Princeton University](https://evictionlab.org/map/)
  - [Beirut Urban Lab, "Beirut Built Environment Database"](https://www.beiruturbanlab.com/en/Details/561)
