## Critical Cartography Through Intentional Re/Misuse

### Due: 9/24


*"Data are always collected for a specific purpose, by a combination of people, technology, money, commerce, and government."* (Kurgan 2013, 35)

### The main task

Find two digital spatial datasets about a place (that is **not** New York City) that are related to a topic that interests you and have some relevance to one another. Create a single map which uses these two datasets together to make an argument that was likely not intended by the original creator(s) of either dataset.

Write a pithy 2 sentence summary of your map's intended argument (think of this as something like gallery text that might accompany a work of art).  


### Requirements and considerations

- The place you select must be somewhere that you have lived and/or spent a significant enough amount of time to know something about lived experience there.

- Investigate the origins of your two datasets. Some starting points to cover (at a minimum): who made the data? what is/was the intended use(s) the data? when was the data made? how was it made?  

- Craft an argument through the juxtaposition, overlay, or presentation of the two datasets together in a map. This argument should try to in some way alter, stretch, or subvert the originally intended use of one or both datasets.

- Research the appropriate projected coordinate reference system to use for your chosen place, reproject your data and map canvas accordingly (see tutorial 2)

- Consider the role that the title and other map elements can play in assisting you in making your argument clear.  

- As you design your map choose one of the projects we have looked at thus far in class as a visual precedent (see GoogleDrive for slides, and the Miro board), and imitate some aspect of its graphic style.  

- I suggest working with vector datasets for this assignment (but not required). When looking for vector geospatial data you should be looking for one of these file types:
  - shapefile
  - geojson
  - KML/KMZ
  - a csv with latitude and longitude coordinates (review tutorial 2 for how to open something like this)
- If you plan to use raster data you should be looking for something with a '.tif' format or that is called a 'geoTIFF' or 'geoJPG'


### Format

- Your final map must be a designed map composition on a single slide with a 16:9 aspect ratio. 
- Your designed map composition must thoughtfully include:
  - title
  - legend
  - scale bar
  - north arrow (your map doesn't need to have north be pointing vertically...)
  - citations for all data sources 
  - projection used
  - your name
- 
### Submission

- Upload your map:
  - as a PDF document to Canvas (the PDF should include your 2 sentence summary on a second page)
  - add it to the pin-up section for 9/24 in the course Miro board (with your gallery text as an annotation below your map)

### Starting points/guidance

For sources for spatial datasets see:
- [Columbia Library Geodata Portal](https://geodata.library.columbia.edu)
- Local and State Government operated Open Data Portals
- University Mapping and/or Research Centers. For example:
  - [Eviction Lab. "Eviction Filing Rate & Evictions Rate." Princeton University](https://evictionlab.org/map/)
  - [Beirut Urban Lab, "Beirut Built Environment Database"](https://www.beiruturbanlab.com/en/Details/561) 

A general rule of thumb for finding data: think about who would have the motivation (and the money/resources) to create the dataset you are looking for then try to research that entity.  

[This guide](https://www.vam.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/238077/Gallery-Text-at-the-V-and-A-Ten-Point-Guide-Aug-2013.pdf) to writing clear gallery text from the Victoria & Albert Museum is perhaps helpful in composing your map description.
