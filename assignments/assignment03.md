## Collecting & Mapping

### Due: 10/8

### What

Create a vector dataset of point locations through field work using the GPS receiver of a cell phone. The points should represent the locations of some *thing* (object, phenomena, landmark) that you encounter in the immediate surroundings of your everyday life or significant points along some kind of *path* (route, invisible border, etc). Design a map using the dataset you created.

Note: you may *not* use maptiles (Stamen, Open Street Maps, XYZ Tiles) as the basemap for this assignment but must instead locate data to design your own basemap (or design your map in such a way that a basemap isn't necessary...). See suggestions below for places to look for basemap datasets for NYC.  


### How

Begin by reading through [Tutorial 3](/methods-in-spatial-research-fa2021/tutorials/tutorial03/). This tutorial will walk you through how to use [Epicollect](https://five.epicollect.net/) -- a digital data collection tool that works on cell phones. You will create an account and set up a new 'form' or data collection tool. Unlike previous weeks there is not a separate deliverable for tutorial 3, instead you will need to use it as a resource for creating your own data gathering instrument.  

After you have a grasp on the process of setting up a form to collect data then:

- Decide on what you would like to collect data about. (Choose a location you can easily travel to and where you will feel comfortable being in public space.)
- Write out what information you would like to collect about each point location (these will become the fields in the attribute table of the new dataset you are creating)
- Design a form to collect point locations and each of the attribute fields you are interested in using the Epicollect website and app described in [Tutorial 3](/methods-in-spatial-research-fa2021/tutorials/tutorial03/).  
- Go out into the world and collect your data. (Please observe social distancing & wear a mask).
- Export it as a CSV file, and create a map of it in QGIS

### Requirements

- Collect ten to fifteen data points, or as many as is necessary to convey what you hope to show in your map.
- Design a map that uses a graphic/visual approach which is related in some way to the data it is depicting OR some aspect of the experience of collecting that data (as always, draw on precedent projects!!)
- In assembling data for your basemap you might look to:  
  - DOITT [NYC Planimetric Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doitt/residents/gis-2d-data.page)
  - NYC Open Data, [NYC Street Trees](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh)
  - NYC Open Data, [NYC curblines](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/Curbs/ikvd-dex8)
  - NYC Open Data [homepage](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)

### Format

- Your final map must be a designed map composition. You are encouraged to select one of the map examples discussed thus far during class and imitate some aspect of its graphic style.  
- Your designed map composition must include:
  - title
  - legend
  - scale bar
  - north arrow (your map doesn't need to have north pointing vertically...)
  - citations for all data sources  
  - projection used
  - your name  

### Submission

- Upload your map:
  - as a pdf to Canvas
  - add it to the pin-up Google Slides presentation for 10/1 in the course Google Drive folder
