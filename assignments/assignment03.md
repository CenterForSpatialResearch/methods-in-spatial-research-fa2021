## Collecting & Mapping

### Due: 10/8

### What

Create a vector dataset of point locations through field work using the GPS receiver of a cell phone. The points should represent the locations of some *thing* (object, phenomena, landmark) that you encounter in the immediate surroundings of your everyday life. Design a map of the dataset you created.

### How

Begin by reading through [Tutorial 3](/methods-in-spatial-research-fa2021/tutorials/tutorial03/). This tutorial will walk you through how to use [Epicollect](https://five.epicollect.net/) -- a digital data collection tool that works on cell phones. You will create an account and set up a new 'form' or data collection tool. Unlike previous weeks there is not a separate deliverable for tutorial 3, instead you will need to use it as a resource for creating your own data gathering instrument. 

After you have a grasp on the process of setting up a form to collect data then:

- Decide on what you would like to collect data about. (Choose a location you can easily travel to and where you will feel comfortable being in public space.)
- Write out what information you would like to collect about each point location (these will become the fields in the attribute table of the new dataset you are creating)
- Design a form to collect point locations and each of the attribute fields you are interested in using the Epicollect website and app described in [Tutorial 3](/methods-in-spatial-research-fa2021/tutorials/tutorial03/).  
- Go out into the world and collect your data. (Please observe social distancing & wear a mask).
- Export it as a CSV file, and create a map of it in QGIS

### Requirements

- Collect at least fifteen data points, or as many as is necessary to convey what you hope to in your map.
- Design a map that uses a graphic/visual approach which is related in some way to the data it is depicting OR some aspect of the experience of collecting that data (this is a chance to draw on precedent projects!)

### Format

- Your final map must be a designed map composition on a single slide with a 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080 pixels). You are encouraged to select one of the map examples discussed thus far during class (either in [lecture slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hfe-0J27vBXeW9y-oFTMd9KTYK48vPxP) or during a [group exercise](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fvWKWTDh4f3LobTapJL-ZU9y-5k3LPE2)) and imitate its graphic style. 
- Your designed map composition must include:
  - title
  - legend
  - scale bar
  - north arrow (your map doesn't need to have north pointing vertically...)
  - citations for all data sources  
  - projection used
  - your name  

### Submission

- Upload your map:
  - as a pdf to Canvas
  - add it to the pin-up Google Slides presentation for 10/1 in the course Google Drive folder
