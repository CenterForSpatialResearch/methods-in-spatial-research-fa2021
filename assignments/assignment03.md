## Selective Digitization

### Due: 2/12

### What

Research and obtain a scanned map, georeference it, and then digitize selected features in order to produce a new map that has a different focus or narrative. Design a map composition that shows the georeferenced map and your new map of digitized features side by side. 

### Requirements 

- Your final work must be a designed map composition with two maps (your georeferenced map and your new map of selectively digitized features) on a single slide with a 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080 pixels).
- You are encouraged to select one of the map examples discussed thus far during class (either in [lecture slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tQHHcbWB65EVjiqt-9ajyd5sVMHPuzls&authuser=db2672%40columbia.edu&usp=drive_fs) or during a [group exercise](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f39yOn8mfryxkJdiHvaqJ3zQGA8elu47&authuser=db2672%40columbia.edu&usp=drive_fs)) and imitate its graphic style when designing the map of digitized features. To questions about map design from class on 2/5: this is the best way to learn and practice designing beautiful maps.

- Your designed map composition must include:
  - title
  - legend
  - scale bar (or two depending on whether you show your map at the same scale...)
  - north arrow (your map doesn't need to have north pointing vertically...)
  - citations for all data sources (please use Chicago style or an equivalent) 
  - projection used
  - your name  

### Submission

- Upload your map:
  - as a pdf to Canvas
  - add it to the pin-up Google Slides presentation for 2/12 in the course Google Drive folder
